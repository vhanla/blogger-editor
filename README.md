# Blogger Desktop

A WebView2 "desktop" client for Windows that adds some features to make it easier to manage files (drag drop), image conversion, and other things.

It is just a wrapper for the blogger site, and it adds a right panel to handle our files, specially pictures.

Currently it syncs and creates directories associated with your blog site posts ID and domain name, so you will have organized all your new files for the post you're creating or editing.

It also allows you to paste pictures from the clipboard, and automatically shows new pictures in the clipboard so you can save them as jpeg or png file format in order to drag and drop
in your post. 

So, why to do that? Because pasting from clipboard to the editor using the Ctrl+V hotkey works, but it pastes big files, that's a blogger native functionality.
